This project is an employee dashboard developed during my internship at Siemens. 
The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for capturing and storing employee details, including name, age, gender, designation, and years of experience. When users submit the employee information, it is securely stored in a MySQL database using the robust Spring Boot framework in conjunction with Hibernate for efficient data management and persistence. The employee dashboard serves as a centralized system for effectively managing employee data within the organization. The frontend of the employee dashboard is built using Angular, a flexible and powerful JavaScript framework. Angular seamlessly integrates with RESTful APIs, enabling efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
